Welcome to the UberIT "Uber for Tech Support": On-Demand Tech Support!

This is an experiment that might not work out in the long run but we'd like to see if it can!

View, post, or vote on a feature request
View existing feature requests
Feature requests are stored in GitHub as issues and can be accessed in the Issues section.

If the Issues section does not exist at this location or you're unable to post a new feature request, it means that we've closed it down temporarily to manage. It will become available when maintenance is finished, so check back later.

Post a feature request
If you've viewed the list of feature requests and yours isn't listed, post it in Issues. Make sure to select the right product so it gets labeled appropriately.

Vote feature requests up or down
When you open a feature request (issue), you'll see a smiley face. If you want to vote in favor of that feature, click that icon and select the Thumbs Up icon. This ensures your vote is counted and allow us to filter the results by the number of Thumbs Up votes.

Note: Thumbs Up is the only accepted way to vote, even though other options appear. (If we could remove them, we would.) Comments and other icon clicks will not be counted towards the vote total.

If you don't think the feature is a good idea, click the Thumbs Down icon instead.




Caveats:

We may edit or consolidate issues to keep them tidy and organized and to improve clarity, all to help us make decisions about which issues to implement.
Just because a feature request is really popular doesn't mean it will get added. While customer feedback is really important to us, there are other factors we include in feature decisions.

Click Projects > Roadmap or just click. You can see what feature requests we are considering, what we've already started or are testing, and what was recently pushed live.
